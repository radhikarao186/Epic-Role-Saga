Traditional dice games often lack digital interactivity and accessibility across different devices. To enhance user engagement, an interactive web-based dice game has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features real-time scoring, allowing players to track their progress instantly after each round. Users can personalize their experience by entering player names through a prompt input. A responsive UI ensures seamless gameplay on various screen sizes and devices. With JavaScript handling game logic, scoring, and user interactions, the game delivers an intuitive and dynamic gaming experience.
